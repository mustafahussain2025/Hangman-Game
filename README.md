# Hangman Game
# Introduction
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that is both fun and educational. It is traditionally played with paper and pencil, but in this project, we will create a digital version using Python. The game involves a player trying to guess a word selected by the computer by suggesting letters one at a time. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game is over, represented by the drawing of a hangman.

# Game Description
In Hangman, the objective is to guess the hidden word selected by the computer before running out of attempts. The game proceeds as follows:

Word Selection: The computer randomly picks a word from a predefined list of words. The word is kept hidden from the player.
Displaying the Word: The word is displayed as a series of underscores, with each underscore representing a letter in the word. For example, if the word is "PYTHON", it will be displayed as "_ _ _ _ _ _".
Guessing Letters: The player guesses one letter at a time. If the guessed letter is in the word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed in their correct positions. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the player loses one guess.
Tracking Progress: The game keeps track of the letters the player has already guessed and the number of incorrect guesses remaining. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to losing.
Winning and Losing: The player wins the game if they guess all the letters in the word before running out of guesses. The player loses the game if they use up all their incorrect guesses before guessing the word. In the traditional game, each incorrect guess leads to drawing another part of the hangman figure, with the game ending when the figure is complete.

# Implementation in Python
We will use Python to implement this game. The core elements of our implementation will include:

Selecting a random word from a list.
Displaying the current state of the word with guessed letters and underscores.
Allowing the player to input their guesses.
Updating the display based on correct and incorrect guesses.
Keeping track of the guessed letters and the number of incorrect guesses.
Determining the win or lose conditions and displaying appropriate messages.
# Example
Here's a simplified example of how the game flow might look:

Computer Selects a Word: "PYTHON"
Initial Display: _ _ _ _ _ _
Player Guesses 'P': Correct! Display: P _ _ _ _ _
Player Guesses 'X': Incorrect! Incorrect Guesses Left: 5
Player Guesses 'Y': Correct! Display: P Y _ _ _ _
Player Guesses 'N': Correct! Display: P Y _ _ _ N
Player Continues Guessing: The game continues until the player guesses the word or runs out of incorrect guesses.
# Conclusion
Hangman is a simple yet engaging game that helps players improve their vocabulary and spelling skills. Implementing this game in Python is a great way to practice programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and lists. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, creating a Hangman game is a fun project that provides a solid foundation for further exploration in game development.
